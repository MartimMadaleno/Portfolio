            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Martim Madaleno </span>

            <br />
            Seeking an exciting new opportunity where I can contribute and grow with a team.
            <br />
            At 42 school, I'm immersed in a unique education model that fosters autonomy and teamwork, teaching me to navigate complex projects with peers effectively.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
